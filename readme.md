> Get Jev fast — TypeSafe’s sharp “System One” model for typed decisions (choice, score, boolean with confidence) — plus kindred models worth watching when the community is buzzing.

Tired of mega-directories with 400 quiet clones? Same. This list stays small, ships **notes** (why it matters, who it's for, what to watch), and leans on **community research** — measured loops, launch threads on X, patterns people keep quoting. Hope you find something you can take into your next build.

## What makes this list different

Mega-directories already cover **breadth** ([awesomejev.com](https://awesomejev.com/), [yibie/awesome-jev](https://github.com/yibie/awesome-jev), [AbdelStark/awesome-typesafe](https://github.com/AbdelStark/awesome-typesafe)). We cover **taste**.

| Others often do | We do |
| --- | --- |
| Scrape / mirror hundreds of repos | A short list you can finish with coffee |
| One-line marketing blurbs | **Editorial notes** — why it matters, caveats, who it is for |
| Stars as the ranking signal | **Community research** — measured loops, launch threads (especially X), patterns people actually quote |
| Only “calls TypeSafe API” | Also **Jev-like / related models** when X (or HN) shows real interest — clearly labeled not TypeSafe |
| Treat every fork as equal | Best-in-class per pattern; thin Ultrafast wrappers get a polite pass |

Standing on the shoulders of lists we like:

- [sindresorhus/awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) / [awesome-nodejs](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-nodejs) — curation over collection; high bar; say *why* something is awesome.
- [awesome-selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) — sharp scope, honest “not here” buckets.

## How we curate

Two tracks. Be picky on both.

### Direct Jev / TypeSafe

In when **at least two** are true:

1. Real TypeSafe / Jev API usage (or official docs / SDK), not a name collision.
2. You could ship or reuse a pattern from it this week (cost, latency, action space, routing, review).
3. Public discussion beyond a quiet README (launch threads, cost/latency numbers, forks that cite it).

### Jev-like / related models (may not call Jev)

In when public discussion (especially **X**, sometimes HN) signals **practical interest or heat**, even if the project never calls TypeSafe. Label clearly as independent / inspired-by. Stars alone are not enough; a quoted thread or measured demo usually is.

Out: dump directories, unused renames, thin Ultrafast clones, and name collisions. If similar to an existing entry, argue in the PR **how it is better**.

## Observations

- **Jev wins when the action space is finite and observed.** Projects that moved the needle on X ([Browser Use flights](https://x.com/gregpr07/status/2100411066966749359), [Mac computer-use cost](https://x.com/awlevin/status/2100262612428894676)) turn the world into an indexed table, then ask one parallel pass. Free-form “do whatever” agents are the wrong fit.
- **Small LLM only for text generation.** Ultrafast and computer-use keep a text model for typing. That split is the recurring architecture.
- **Coding-agent use is about gates, not authorship.** Compaction, review, tool allow/deny, and model routing are natural System One jobs.
- **Latency narratives travel farther than star counts.** Prefer measured loops. [fast-jev-compaction](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction) is listed for trend and usefulness even without a widely cited launch thread.
- **Access path matters.** [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/changelog/typesafe-ai-jev-now-available-on-ai-gateway) (`typesafe-ai/jev`) changed who could experiment overnight ([@vercel_dev](https://x.com/vercel_dev/status/2100378959653507175)).
- **High-heat concepts without a shippable repo still matter.** They live in [Use cases & concepts](#use-cases--concepts) — discussion threads and essays that illustrate a System One pattern. Viral flex with weak verification stays out or gets a one-line caveat.
- **Jev-like heat is a signal, not affiliation.** SemIf / jevlike teach open alternatives; X/HN chatter is why they sit here — always label independent.

## Official

- [TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai) - The mothership: product home, early-access console, and the cleanest place to feel what Jev is selling. Start here if you are evaluating whether System One fits your stack — less “docs dump,” more “can I try this.” Caveat: early access still means some doors open slower than the community demos imply.
- [System One docs](https://docs.typesafe.ai) - The sharpest written answer to “what is Jev good at?” Atomic typed questions yes; long System-2 prose no. We list it because every good integration quietly mirrors this mental model. Ideal for architects drafting prompts and schemas before they burn API credits.
- [typesafe-sdk-js](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-js) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-js?style=flat) - Official TypeScript/JavaScript client (`@typesafe-ai/sdk`) — the default on-ramp if your app already lives in Node or the browser. Selected because it is the path of least resistance from “interesting paper” to typed Choice/Score/Boolean in production code. Skip the DIY fetch wrappers unless you enjoy rediscovering auth edge cases.
- [typesafe-sdk-python](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-python) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/typesafe-ai/typesafe-sdk-python?style=flat) - Official Python client for the same System One surface. Best for data/ML folks who want Jev beside notebooks and agents without pretending TypeScript is mandatory. Thin but trustworthy — treat it as the blessed client, not a research sketch.
- [system-one-adapter-python](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/system-one-adapter-python) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/typesafe-ai/system-one-adapter-python?style=flat) - Drop-in `TypeSafeClient` backed by ordinary chat LLMs so you can A/B and offline-compare without waiting on the real model. We picked it for teams who need a fair baseline before they commit spend. Caveat: it is a stand-in, not a free Jev — keep that label loud in your eval notes.
- [skills](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/skills) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/typesafe-ai/skills?style=flat) - Official agent skills for building against the System One API — the “start cooking with the right utensils” pack. Included because [@typesafeai](https://x.com/typesafeai/status/2100376436272173088) framed it as how serious builders should bootstrap. Aimed at agent authors who want conventions, not another blank repo.
- [Cloudflare Workers AI — typesafe/jev](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai/models/typesafe/jev/) - Hosted model listing on Cloudflare’s AI platform if your runtime already is Workers-shaped. Worth a bookmark when you care more about edge colocations than about owning the client stack. Not a tutorial; more a “yes, it is actually available here” receipt.

## Platforms

- [Jev on Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/changelog/typesafe-ai-jev-now-available-on-ai-gateway) - Call `typesafe-ai/jev` through AI SDK 7 `evaluate` without waiting on a private waitlist — the overnight on-ramp that actually changed who could experiment. It ranks high because [@vercel_dev](https://x.com/vercel_dev/status/2100378959653507175) turned access into a product story, not a footnote. Perfect for Next.js / AI SDK shops; just remember Gateway quotas are still quotas.
- [AI SDK `experimental_evaluate`](https://sdk.vercel.ai) - Native Choice / Score / Boolean path that looks like System One answers already live in your application code. Selected as the ergonomic twin of the Gateway entry — same mental model, fewer glue files. Experimental name is honest: APIs can still move under you.

## Browser & computer use

- [jev-ultrafast](https://github.com/browser-use/jev-ultrafast) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/browser-use/jev-ultrafast?style=flat) - Browser Use’s flagship loop and still the clearest “why Jev” demo on the internet: DOM → indexed ops/targets → one Jev round trip, with a small LLM only for typing. Zürich→London Flights (~7s, ~$0.0039) plus [@gregpr07](https://x.com/gregpr07/status/2100411066966749359) made the latency story travel farther than any star chart. Reuse this architecture if you have a finite, observed action space; skip it if your agent is still “do whatever.”
- [typesafe-computer-use](https://github.com/awlevin/typesafe-computer-use) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/awlevin/typesafe-computer-use?style=flat) - macOS computer-use via OCR + Jev, with a cost table that made people sit up (~$0.0002/step in the author’s numbers). Worth a look because [@awlevin](https://x.com/awlevin/status/2100262612428894676) turned desktop automation into a measured System One story, not a vibes reel. Best for Mac-native builders; OCR noise is the tax you pay for skipping a perfect accessibility tree.
- [jev-browser-pilot](https://github.com/aidil2105/jev-browser-pilot) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/aidil2105/jev-browser-pilot?style=flat) - Library-shaped pilot (surface, perception, policy, verify, safety, traces) for people designing their own loop instead of forking Ultrafast. Stars are quiet; the structure is not — that is exactly why it is here. Prefer when you want seams you can swap; skip if you just need a working flights demo tonight.

**Not listed yet:** thin browser wrappers of Ultrafast with no new measurement or X traction (including mobile ports — ping us when the thread heats up).

## Coding agents

- [fast-jev-compaction](https://github.com/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tamaratran/fast-jev-compaction?style=flat) - Claude Code plugin where Jev scores tool calls/results and kept context stays verbatim — compaction as a gate, not a summarizer that invents. High stars and strong trend even without a widely cited launch thread, which is why our Observations call it out. For Claude Code power users drowning in tool noise; watch for over-aggressive drops if your tasks need long tails of boring context.
- [foreman](https://github.com/thruwire/foreman) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/thruwire/foreman?style=flat) - Software-factory supervision with Jev judging steps — less “write my PR,” more “did this stage actually pass?” Strong Codex-supervision angle from [@JoshARosen](https://x.com/JoshARosen/status/2100573432089866717). Aimed at multi-agent factory builders; overkill if you only need a single review bot.
- [jev-review (devagrawal09)](https://github.com/devagrawal09/jev-review) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/devagrawal09/jev-review?style=flat) - Staged review plus a local dashboard — the community’s favorite “show me the gates” review shape. Cited in roundups such as [@0xLogicrw](https://x.com/0xLogicrw/status/2100478725393686556), which is enough heat for a review tool. Great when you want human-visible stages; heavier than a one-shot MCP call.
- [jev-review (NiazMorshed2007)](https://github.com/NiazMorshed2007/jev-review) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/NiazMorshed2007/jev-review?style=flat) - Local-first MCP `jev_review` when your stack is already MCP-shaped. Prefer this sibling if Claude/Cursor tools are your front door; less X signal than the staged-review cousin, and that is fine. Caveat: MCP-first joy, dashboard-second polish.
- [pi-jev](https://github.com/y0usaf/pi-jev) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/y0usaf/pi-jev?style=flat) - Decision layer for Pi: tool-call gate plus `jev_ask` so the agent asks before it acts. Selected as a clean “System One as permissioning” pattern inside a specific agent runtime. For Pi users who want typed vetoes; not a general coding agent on its own.
- [pi-warden](https://github.com/DevMortimer/pi-warden) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/DevMortimer/pi-warden?style=flat) - Pi guardrails against irreversible tools, loops, and fake “done,” steered by Jev. Pairs naturally with pi-jev when you care about safety theater becoming real checks. Best for operators who have already been burned by an agent that “finished” too early.
- [jev-belay](https://github.com/valentynkit/jev-belay) - Claude Code Stop hook that reads the transcript for evidence and only spends a four-question Jev call when files changed with nothing passing since, before letting an unverified "done" stand. Selected for the evidence gate itself, not the guardrail idea in general - it fails open on every error path. Best for Claude Code users tired of babysitting closing messages; the honest catch is a turn with no file edits never reaches the check.
- [jev-commit](https://github.com/valentynkit/jev-commit) - Pre-commit hook where one Jev call checks whether the commit message actually matches the staged diff, plus debug leftovers and unmentioned work, with a hard block only on a leaked credential. For teams whose agents write commit messages as confidently as they write bugs; it warns rather than blocks on everything but a secret, so it stays out of the way.

## Routers

- [jev-router](https://github.com/gargpratyush/jev-router) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/gargpratyush/jev-router?style=flat) - Per-turn cheap/strong routing for Claude Code and Codex — still the most-cited router pattern in this ecosystem. X heat is quieter than the browser demos, but usefulness is why it stays. Watch cost regressions when the “cheap” model starts failing the hard turns you thought were easy.
- [hono-jev-router](https://github.com/yusukebe/hono-jev-router) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/yusukebe/hono-jev-router?style=flat) - Semantic HTTP routing for Hono: Jev picks a route, your handlers stay boring. Small, clean proof that System One is not only a coding-agent toy. For Hono / edge API folks; overkill if a static path table already works.

## Data & libraries

- [pg-jev](https://github.com/realZachi/pg-jev) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/realZachi/pg-jev?style=flat) - PostgreSQL extension that lets you ask tables questions in plain language via Jev — rare “decision model lives next to the data” angle. X is quiet; niche utility is loud, which is enough for us. For SQL-native teams; not a substitute for a proper analytics warehouse story.

## Demos worth studying

- [jev-trader](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/jev-trader) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jarrodwatts/jev-trader?style=flat) - One buy/sell decision per Monad block on Kuru MON-USDC — a hot loop with a calibrated choice, not a chatbot that “feels bullish.” [@jarrodwatts](https://x.com/jarrodwatts/status/2100356151468585346) made the template travel. Study the pacing; do not treat it as financial advice or a production trading desk.
- [typesafe-mario](https://github.com/fhshaik/typesafe-mario) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/fhshaik/typesafe-mario?style=flat) - Mario driven from structured emulator state — a toy surface with a serious lesson: feed observed state, not raw pixels, when you can. Listed for teaching action-space hygiene. Fun first; production second (or never).
- [jev-plays-pokemon-red](https://github.com/valentynkit/jev-plays-pokemon-red) - Pokemon Red on PyBoy where code owns the route and the arithmetic and Jev only picks at branches, with every battle turn logging a faint prediction scored by Brier against what the RAM actually says. Selected for the self-scoring habit more than the game itself: it says plainly when the sample is too small to trust rather than claiming calibration it hasn't earned. Fun first, but a clean template for checking confidence instead of just asserting it.


## Use cases & concepts

Discussion threads and essays that illustrate System One patterns in the wild. Many are demos or write-ups without a polished public repo (unless noted). When a solid open artifact appears, it may move into the main categories above.

### Framing

- [LLMs generate answers. Jev makes decisions.](https://x.com/paarangatrai/status/2100113737097367896) - One-line mental model that stuck hard on X. Use it to explain System One to teammates; it is a frame, not a product.
- [WTF Is Jev? 9 Things People Are Already Building](https://x.com/mvanhorn/status/2100784142850097482) - Pattern roundup with receipts: give candidates (do not invent), fast reacts / slow plans, measured loops. Best as a map of *what to look for*, not a clone checklist.
- [Building a Harness with Jev (LangChain)](https://x.com/sydneyrunkle/status/2100754364545761643) - Architecture write-up: Jev as gates inside the agent loop (routing, risky-tool checks). Study the harness shape; the primary artifact is the blog / LangChain middleware, not a toy demo repo.

### Product-shaped demos (repo optional)

- [Intent launcher — “the PDF I just downloaded”](https://x.com/dabit3/status/2100756930054504776) - Keystroke intent over a finite candidate set (~100 ms). Working code lives in [dabit3/jev-experiments](https://github.com/dabit3/jev-experiments) (`jev-launcher`); listed here as a use-case story first because the X thread is what people quote.
- [Predictive spreadsheet — column header as schema](https://x.com/dabit3/status/2100780008193020049) - “Spreadsheets recalculate numbers, not meaning.” Same experiments repo (`judge-sheets`). Strong metaphor for inbox / triage tables.
- [Voice → Jev → browser clicks](https://x.com/moritzkremb/status/2100577979021832365) - Hands-busy control loop (~300 ms / ~$0.0002 in the author’s numbers). Video demo; no public repo verified — pattern only.
- [On-device OCR labels → Jev pick-to-click](https://x.com/milindlabs/status/2100631847155994852) - Local perception, text-only to Jev (~90 ms). Complements listed [typesafe-computer-use](https://github.com/awlevin/typesafe-computer-use); different author, same “observed action space” lesson. No repo verified.

### Real-time / multi-agent concepts

- [Minecraft: Jev reacts, Astra plans](https://x.com/wuyang_zhou/status/2100727660875808913) - Fast System One + slow System Two split under live load. No public repo verified; learn from the role boundary, not the clip.
- [Emotion cellular automata](https://x.com/riku720720/status/2100738087584481657) - Many parallel agents updating state with Jev — unusual multi-body concept (not another single-player bot). Lower likes; higher novelty.

### Circulating (caveats)

Widely shared demos with real heat but no clean public ship target yet — useful for orientation, not as copy-paste starters:

- [“Rebuilt Tesla FSD in under an hour”](https://x.com/jpschroeder/status/2100347770867458384) - Extreme loop story; treat claims as marketing until reproducible.
- [Subway Surfers + 50 parallel games](https://x.com/_MaxBlade/status/2100634359099232678) - Parallel decision-cost narrative; demo-only.
- [Slay the Spire 2 ~0.7s picks](https://x.com/coolish/status/2100570517954838897) - Finite game action space; demo-only.
- [Viral post scorer (61 questions / SuperX)](https://x.com/robj3d3/status/2100722975645598191) - Parallel multi-question scoring as a product try-link; no public GitHub in the thread.

## Jev-like & related models

Independent projects and **related / inspired models** that explore System One–style decisions. They may **not** call TypeSafe Jev. Inclusion is driven by **discussion heat and study value**, not affiliation.

- [SemIf](https://github.com/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/TheoLeeCJ/SemIf?style=flat) - “Semantic ifs” from open models on a home 3090 — explicitly independent, not affiliated with TypeSafe. Sparse X (e.g. [@hhkkmon](https://x.com/hhkkmon/status/2100443314957038010)) but enough inspired-by signal for tinkerers who want local conditionals. For DIY GPU owners; expect research edges, not a polished SaaS twin.
- [jevlike](https://github.com/vinnylarouge/jevlike) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/vinnylarouge/jevlike?style=flat) - Train a small model for one-pass option probabilities (Doom / chess / Wikispeedia). Independent / inspired-by study piece with sparse X plus solid HN traction (~161 pts). Great if you want to feel how System One–shaped outputs are learned; not a drop-in Jev replacement and not affiliated.
- [laya](https://github.com/NandhaKishorM/laya) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/NandhaKishorM/laya?style=flat) - Open System One–flavored decision model you can run locally ([HF](https://huggingface.co/convaiinnovations/laya), PyPI `laya`) — **not affiliated with TypeSafe**. Notable for the shippable stack and the **selective gating** story (abstain / defer when unsure). Author-published latency/accuracy charts vs Jev are interesting radar, **not** a shared benchmark: Jev numbers often lean on frontier agreement, Laya on in-task self-eval — do not read them as “beats Jev.” For builders who want an open alternative to try; keep the methodology caveat in mind.
- [nimble](https://github.com/bespokelabsai/nimble) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bespokelabsai/nimble?style=flat) - Open “Jev recipe” (LoRA + constrained serving) — not affiliated with TypeSafe; the recipe itself is the product, which is why it is here. [@madiator](https://x.com/madiator/status/2100990591215783946) and HN both gave it heat. For teams who want to cook their own System One–ish model; bring ML ops patience.
- [openjev-sglang](https://github.com/ekzhang/openjev-sglang) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ekzhang/openjev-sglang?style=flat) - Prefill-only Jev-compatible API on SGLang — independent, not affiliated. HN discussion is the inclusion ticket: serving shape matters as much as model weights. For infra folks already living in SGLang; read “compatible” as “shape-alike,” not “official.”
- [open-jev](https://github.com/daseinlabs/open-jev) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/daseinlabs/open-jev?style=flat) - Local Gemma/MLX option scoring. Not affiliated with TypeSafe; on the list for HN curiosity and laptop-friendly experiments. Ideal for Apple/local explorers; treat scores as educational, not production calibration.
- [mini-jev](https://github.com/r-ms/mini-jev) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/r-ms/mini-jev?style=flat) - Small Qwen3 letter-logits experiment toward System One–style choices. Independent, not affiliated; HN is why it sits here. For researchers poking logits with a stick — charming, not a product.
- [jevmlx](https://github.com/bnsd55/jevmlx) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/bnsd55/jevmlx?style=flat) - Parallel decisions on Apple Silicon via MLX. Not affiliated; heat from [@beni_il_](https://x.com/beni_il_/status/2100617387116568956) and HN. Best for Mac MLX natives chasing parallel Choice-shaped calls; bring your own eval harness.
- [Qwen-2.5-1B-RLCD](https://huggingface.co/harshatheg/Qwen-2.5-1B-RLCD) ![HF likes](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2Fapi%2Fmodels%2Fharshatheg%2FQwen-2.5-1B-RLCD&query=%24.likes&label=HF%20likes&style=flat) - Parallel constrained / multi-field decisions as an HF model — independent, not TypeSafe. Strong X from [@harshagundal](https://x.com/harshagundal/status/2100044305536889015) earned the slot. For people who want a downloadable brain, not an API key; verify constraints before you trust multi-field outputs.
- [LitJev](https://github.com/zhengxuyu/LitJev) ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zhengxuyu/LitJev?style=flat) - Wrap an arbitrary LLM into a Jev-like `/v1/systemone` surface. Not affiliated; [@yuzxfred](https://x.com/yuzxfred/status/2100652136878981337) put the adapter pattern on the map. Handy for protocol experiments; remember a wrapper does not magically become System One quality.

More entries welcome when X (or HN) shows sustained practical interest — open a PR with the thread.
